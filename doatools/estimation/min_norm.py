class MinNorm(SpectrumBasedEstimatorBase):
    """Creates a spectrum-based Min-Norm estimator.

    The Min-Norm spectrum is computed on a predefined-grid, and the source
    locations are estimated by identifying the peaks.

    Args:
        array (~doatools.model.arrays.ArrayDesign): Array design.
        wavelength (float): Wavelength of the carrier wave.
        search_grid (~doatools.estimation.grid.SearchGrid): The search grid
            used to locate the sources.
        **kwargs: Other keyword arguments supported by
            :class:`~doatools.estimation.core.SpectrumBasedEstimatorBase`.

    Notes:
        The Min-Norm algorithm is sometimes referred to in the literature as a
        weighted MUSIC algorithm because it uses weighted eigenspaces.

        Args:
            R (~numpy.ndarray): Covariance matrix input. The size of R must
                match that of the array design used when creating this
                estimator.
            k (int): Expected number of sources.
            return_spectrum (bool): Set to ``True`` to also output the spectrum
                for visualization. Default value if ``False``.
            refine_estimates (bool): Set to True to enable grid refinement to
                obtain potentially more accurate estimates.
            refinement_density (int): Density of the refinement grids. Higher
                density values lead to denser refinement grids and increased
                computational complexity. Default value is 10.
            refinement_iters (int): Number of refinement iterations. More
                iterations generally lead to better results, at the cost of
                increased computational complexity. Default value is 3.

            A tuple with the following elements.

            * resolved (:class:`bool`): A boolean indicating if the desired
              number of sources are found. This flag does **not** guarantee that
              the estimated source locations are correct. The estimated source
              locations may be completely wrong!
              If resolved is False, both ``estimates`` and ``spectrum`` will be
              ``None``.
            * estimates (:class:`~doatools.model.sources.SourcePlacement`):
              A :class:`~doatools.model.sources.SourcePlacement` instance of the
              same type as the one used in the search grid, represeting the
              estimated source locations. Will be ``None`` if resolved is
              ``False``.
            * spectrum (:class:`~numpy.ndarray`): An numpy array of the same
              shape of the specified search grid, consisting of values evaluated
              at the grid points. Only present if ``return_spectrum`` is
              ``True``.
